**[Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/plouffelul)** if you wish to support my work a little more or without buying my stuff you can do it there

# Developpement
Scripts are tested and developped under ox_core and are made to be usable on 
- *ox_core*
- *es_extended*
- *qb-core*

**Requests**

For any personnal or custom requests you can join the discord and open a ticket.

# Support 

Support is given exclusively in **French or English**

You're expect to have read required documentation 

Support is garanteed for paid scripts, for free scripts i engage to give as much support as i can but you're expected to be able to use your brain. I already have very little hair i would like to keep them.

# Personnal recommendation
- Overextended

If you're making a new server and have decent knowledge of LUA i highly recommend taking a look into overextended stuff.

People there have advanced lua knowledge and make some pretty awesome scripts but not only this they have an extremly good front end dev that takes care of everything front-end related.

So if you never heard of them go check them out on [Github](https://github.com/overextended) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/mEM6eYdXPm)

- Qb-Core

Once again if you're making a new server or you're fairly new to fivem Qb-Core is one of the first thing you might know about.

I strongly recommend **NOT** using the current Qb-Core and instead using the **Remastered** version.

You can find all the information you need about Qb-Core remastered on the fivem forums.

Here is the [Github](https://github.com/QBCore-Remastered) and the [Discord](https://discord.gg/qbcorer)

- Esx 

Esx is pretty straight foward, has existed for a long time and i think its fair to say if you're a pottato you can still make a esx server.

Here goes the [Github](https://github.com/esx-framework) and [Discord](https://discord.esx-framework.org/)

- Project Error

This is basicly where you're going to find the **best** without a doubt front end scripts.

If you need anything that as a ui, check there before anywhere else. [Github](https://github.com/project-error) and [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/HYwBjTbAY5)

# Frequently ask questions

- **I cant join your discord** 

This is most likely because you got banned by warden as im currently writting this the discord is 2 month old and theres already about 300 bans.

You can go [here](https://discord.gg/jeFeDRasfs) and ask for an *appeal*

- **Why are you scripts free but requires a paid lib**

Initially i wanted to engage in only paid releases but i feel like theres just to many paid stuff and not enough free stuff but i also wanted part of the cake. So i had to take a decision on the route i was going to take. 

When i started fivem i was really happy to have the opportunity to learn from open code wich is an opportunity i somewhat wanted to give to other people.

So if i wanted to release some paid stuff and free stuff i figured that one of the best way was to release the depencie as paid and other scripts for free. 

Basicly that makes it so if i have 10 script that would be worth around 30-40$ for free but a 50$ (If you're not taking the 15$ monthly) lib is required to use them someone wanting to use them all would save 300$ and i would still have my little part of the cake. 

*Nothing stops you from manually editing the open code and use any scripts without the lib*
